# About PHP-Bouncer #

PHP-Bouncer is a php library focused on providing flexible access control in situations where strictly hierarchical
access control may not be an option.

## Development Status ##
PHP-Bouncer is a brand new project, and is in the beginning stages of development. There are not currently any stable releases
available for direct download, but anyone can check out a read-only copy of the code base at any time`*`. Alternately, a release candidate is available for direct download on the project home page. If you are
interested in joining the development team feel free to check out the
[Development FAQ](https://code.google.com/p/php-bouncer/wiki/DevFAQ).

`*`NOTE: Using a SVN version of PHP-Bouncer could provide additional functionality or bug fixes, but new and potentially dangerous bugs could be introduced at any time. Use Official or Beta versions when possible, and all others at your own risk
